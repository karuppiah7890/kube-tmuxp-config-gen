This is a list of my findings and learnings while building a Golang project, also a port of an existing project

* [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) - Helper for creating Golang CLI apps
* [ghodss/yaml](https://github.com/ghodss/yaml) - Golang Library for serializing and deserializing yaml. [Libraries.io Page](https://libraries.io/go/github.com%2Fghodss%2Fyaml) A lot of packages use this library. Even Kubernetes uses this package!
